# AES-256 Secure Folder - True Encryption Protection

A Windows batch script that provides **genuine AES-256 encryption** for folder protection. Unlike simple hiding utilities, this script actually encrypts your files using military-grade cryptography with PBKDF2 key derivation, making them completely unreadable without the correct password.

## 🔐 Key Features

- **True AES-256 Encryption** - Military-grade cryptographic protection
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation** - 10,000 iterations with salt for enhanced security
- **Complete File Destruction** - Original folder is permanently deleted after encryption
- **Secure Password Input** - Hidden password entry with no console logging
- **Automatic Compression** - Files are ZIP compressed before encryption for efficiency
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive validation and rollback on failures
- **Self-Contained** - Single batch file with no external dependencies

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

**⚠️ THIS IS REAL ENCRYPTION - READ CAREFULLY:**

- **Password Loss = Data Loss**: If you forget your password, your data is **permanently unrecoverable**
- **No Backdoors**: There are no master passwords, recovery keys, or bypass methods
- **Test First**: Always test with non-critical data before using with important files
- **Backup Essential**: Keep backups of critical data elsewhere before encryption

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Create the Script**
   ```
   Copy the corrected script code → Save as "AESSecureFolder.bat"
   Save Type: "All Files" | Encoding: "UTF-8" or "ANSI"
   ```

2. **Setup**
   ```
   1. Create a folder named "Private" in the same directory as the script
   2. Add your files to the "Private" folder
   3. Double-click AESSecureFolder.bat to run
   ```

### Basic Workflow

```
📁 Private/ (your files) → 🗜️ ZIP Archive → 🔐 Private.locked (encrypted) → 📁 Private/ (restored)
   ↑ Original folder          ↑ Compressed       ↑ AES-256 encrypted      ↑ Decrypted files
   (deleted after encrypt)    (temporary)        (final secure file)       (restored on decrypt)
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Encryption Process
1. **Validation**: Checks folder exists and contains files
2. **Compression**: Creates ZIP archive of folder contents
3. **Key Derivation**: Password → PBKDF2 (10,000 iterations) → AES key + IV
4. **Encryption**: ZIP archive → AES-256-CBC → encrypted binary file
5. **Cleanup**: Deletes ZIP archive and original folder

### Decryption Process
1. **Validation**: Checks encrypted file exists
2. **Key Derivation**: Password → PBKDF2 (same parameters) → AES key + IV
3. **Decryption**: Encrypted file → AES-256-CBC → ZIP archive
4. **Extraction**: ZIP archive → restored folder structure
5. **Cleanup**: Deletes ZIP archive and encrypted file

### Cryptographic Specifications

- **Algorithm**: AES-256 in CBC mode
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-1, 10,000 iterations
- **Salt**: Fixed 16-byte salt "SecureFolder2024Salt"
- **Key Size**: 256-bit encryption key
- **IV Size**: 128-bit initialization vector

   # Note: Private folder is gone - permanently deleted!
   ```

### Decryption Process

1. **Run Decryption**
   ```
   Double-click AESSecureFolder.bat
   → Shows: "1. Decrypt and unlock folder"
   → Press 1
   → Enter password: [hidden input]
   → Wait for completion
   ```

2. **Result After Decryption**
   ```
   ├── AESSecureFolder.bat
   ├── Private/               # Restored folder with all your files
   │   ├── document1.pdf      # All files restored exactly as before
   │   ├── photo.jpg
   │   └── subfolder/
   │       └── file.txt
   # Note: Private.locked is gone - deleted after successful decryption
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Script Settings (Edit at top of script)
```batch
set "LOCKFOLDER=Private"           # Name of folder to encrypt
set "ENCRYPTEDFILE=Private.locked" # Name of encrypted output file
set "TEMPZIP=temp_archive.zip"     # Temporary ZIP file name
```

### Security Parameters (Edit in PowerShell commands)
```powershell
# Change iteration count (currently 10,000)
$key = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.Rfc2898DeriveBytes($password, $salt, 10000)

# Change salt (currently "SecureFolder2024Salt") - WARNING: Changes will make old files unreadable
$salt = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes('SecureFolder2024Salt')
```

## 🛡️ Security Analysis

### ✅ Strong Protection Against
- **File system analysis** - Files are genuinely encrypted, not just hidden
- **Data recovery tools** - Original data is cryptographically destroyed
- **Brute force attacks** - PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations slows attacks significantly
- **Dictionary attacks** - Key stretching makes password cracking expensive
- **Forensic analysis** - Proper encryption leaves no readable traces
- **Casual inspection** - Encrypted file appears as random binary data

### ⚠️ Security Considerations
- **Fixed Salt**: Uses same salt for all encryptions (reduces security vs random salts)
- **Password Strength**: Security depends entirely on password complexity
- **Memory Exposure**: Password briefly stored in system memory during processing
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks theoretically possible during key derivation

### 🎯 Ideal Use Cases
- **Personal sensitive documents** requiring strong protection
- **Business confidential files** on portable storage
- **Financial records** needing compliance-grade encryption
- **Legal documents** with confidentiality requirements
- **Medical records** requiring HIPAA-level protection
- **Development projects** with proprietary source code

## 🚨 Important Warnings & Limitations

### ⚠️ Data Loss Scenarios
```
❌ FORGOTTEN PASSWORD = PERMANENT DATA LOSS (No recovery possible)
❌ CORRUPTED .locked FILE = PERMANENT DATA LOSS (No repair possible)
❌ SCRIPT INTERRUPTION = POTENTIAL DATA LOSS (Original folder deleted)
❌ DISK FULL DURING ENCRYPTION = POTENTIAL DATA LOSS (Incomplete process)
```

### 🔄 Process Safety Features
- **Pre-encryption validation** - Checks folder exists and contains files
- **Compression verification** - Ensures ZIP creation succeeds before proceeding
- **Encryption verification** - Validates encrypted file creation before cleanup
- **Rollback capability** - Preserves original data if encryption fails
- **Overwrite protection** - Warns before overwriting existing folders during decryption

### 💾 Critical Backup Strategy
```
BEFORE FIRST USE:
✅ Test with sample non-critical files
✅ Verify encryption and decryption work correctly
✅ Backup all important data to separate location
✅ Document password in secure password manager

REGULAR MAINTENANCE:
✅ Keep multiple copies of encrypted files
✅ Periodically test decryption process
✅ Update backups after adding new files
✅ Verify encrypted file integrity
```
